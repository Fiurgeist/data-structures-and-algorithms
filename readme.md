### Data Structures And Algorithms

This repo is mostly for fun, to have some well-trodden paths (data structures and algorithms) to try out new languages or do a refresher on known ones.

#### C impls

There's a lot of casting happening, usually to keep the collections generic for use in other parts of the repo. The value-types are usually typedefs of `void *` to easily replace it with the needed type in concrete implementations.
