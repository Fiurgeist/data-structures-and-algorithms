### Insertion Sort

A simple sorting algorithm that is not efficient for large lists, but it is very good for mostly sorted list.
That's way I use it within the A-Star implementation where the open list is sorted each iterations and only the newly added nodes are not yet in their place. (Test with other sorting algs and large A-Star field pending.)
